# HW-3-1-Needleman-Wunsch
Task 3. Programming Project -Implementation of Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm

This week is the start of this programming assignment. Note that the due date for this project is the end of week 3 of Module 3. However, it is highly recommended to start writing the code this week.

The program will take two sequences to be aligned as input. You may use a simple scoring scheme, such as a similar one in the lecture. A user should be allowed to enter the parameter for match, mismatch, and gap respectively. The output is the optimal alignment score and the optimal alignment. Students are also encouraged to use PAM250 matrix to the alignment of two protein sequences, if you enjoy more challenges in programming and make your code more realistic. 

Submission:

Please submit your source code and a brief report that includes the instruction how to compile and run the program. It should also contain information how to locate/interpret your results.
